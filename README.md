OBJECTIVE OF THIS PROJECT

This project represents a bank built on C++ platform.It 
presents a good use of features provided by C++ and especially 
the graphics features.

C++ has a lot of features for the programmers.It includes all 
the features of C and also some extra features as that of the 
class. It has good libraries for programming including many for 
input-output and graphics which are a boon for the 
programmers.

This project makes a good use of all these features provided by 
C++.This banking project is built taking much care of the 
graphics of the project.It has well defined layout representing 
each and every option in a good background.

This project finds various advantages. A manual banking 
project would have been quite awful. To overcome this 
difficulty a program has been generated which enhances as 
well as promotes time saving.

A manual banking would take a lot of time to be conducted. At 
least a group of people is required to conduct the bank. Also it 
would be quite difficult to keep the record of the accounts of 
the investors. It would also be difficult to maintain the record 
of the transactions used by the peoplke time to time.


These all problems have been overcome in this project. It is 
purely the job of the machine to keep the record of each and 
every bit of the bank at each and every time. Also this project 
requires the time of just a single person who wishes to keep 
records of the bank.

Thus overall, this project has overcome many of the problems 
which would have been faced in a simple bank. An automated 
Bank Management would be useful to the user for maintaining 
records easily and accessing them quickly. I as the programmer 
have tried to make it as interesting as it can be made.

It mainly aims at having the following features:-

>User friendly
>Password protected accounts
>Easy and convinient
>Maintaining records
>Quick access
>Interesting
